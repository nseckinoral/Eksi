Facebook?.\r\n\r\n**EksiSözlük** is the first social network on the world which was founded on 1999. It is one of the top three website on Turkey. \r\n\r\nEksisözlük can be defined as a text and topic based informal dictionary. The word \"Ekşi\" refers to \"sour\" and \"Sözlük\" to \"dictionary\". In fact, the name of the brand (or let's say company) is \"sourtimes\". Although it is said \"definition\" none of the entries is guaranteed to be true. All of them are opinions of the writers and the site declares that \"it is all wrong!\".\r\n\r\n## Why Do I Develop This Project?\r\nEksisözlük does not have any rest api or native app on windows store.
