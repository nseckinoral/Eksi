# What is Eksi Sözlük?
Do you know what is the name of first social network on the world? Reddit? Facebook?.

EksiSözlük is the first social network on the world which was founded on 1999. It is one of the top three website on Turkey.Eksisözlük can be defined as a text and topic based informal dictionary. The word "Ekşi" refers to "sour" and "Sözlük" to "dictionary". In fact, the name of the brand (or let's say company) is "sourtimes". Although it is said "definition" none of the entries is guaranteed to be true. All of them are opinions of the writers and the site declares that "it is all wrong!".

##Why Do I Develop This Project?
Eksisözlük does not have any rest api or native app on windows store. So, I decided to do.
